1) Consider how to use MQTT for the project. Based on your experiences, what is made possible us-
ing MQTT? What seems fairly difficult using MQTT? If you were to use MQTT, what would be a
reasonable communications lag time be? Would you prefer to use a different method of transmitting
data?

2) Try more similar sounding words (particularly bad examples may be words like “sound” and
“found”, letters (A, B, C , D, E , F, G). Does the performance start taking a hit?

3) How long of a phrase can work? Is the length of a phrase actually a good thing for
“error correction”?

4) Play music in the background. Go to a coffee shop (or work in the lab). How well does it work in
noise? What are ways to improve its performance in noise?

5) Write some short bullet points with some individual thoughts on how this applies to your project:
    (a) What can you do with your given speech program in the project?
    (b) How complex do you want your speech recognition to be? How complex can you reasonably expect
    your speech recognition to be?
    (c) What level of speech accuracy do you need? In other words, how quickly do you need an accurate
    recognition? Does a missed recognition hurt the progress of the game?
    (d) Do you need specific hardware, specific conditions, etc. to have a reasonable confidence that it
    works well enough?
